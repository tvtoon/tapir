This is a fork from tapir ( https://github.com/qnighy/tapir ), mostly to clean stuff and let it ready for hacking. Someday it will be enhanced up to the limit of portability, as RGSS is inherently Windows API stuff, one can just hope that people don't use external libraries, because when they do, this stuff here is just bullshit and not even WINE can help you...

To compile this stuff, tapir used to hold submodules and pack the object files from ruby together, inside its tree. We use the more "pragmatic" approach, with each ruby version being used as libraries. Another thing that I do not recommend is using the scripts to install the Run Time Packages needed, because the addresses change often and you have to register in the official "western" version. The scripts are kept merely for curiosity, go grab all the stuff inside TKool site ( https://tkool.jp/ ) because it is faster and you won't have problems with links. The XP package is a little different, so you have to cut some directories.
