0.1.3
^Fixed segfault by insane reallocating memory like mad at "Audio.c", fixed cache size now and will only change after implementing hierarchy.
^Daily cleanup and testing at "Bitmap.c" and friends, right or not...
^Conclusion of "exit" stuff, there shouldn't be memory or "exitdoers" trouble anymore.

0.1.2
^The "archive.*" stuff was replaced by external archive extractor "rgssad.c".
^Stuff inside "openres.*" was almost completely remade.
^The atexit and exit functions call were replaced by common exception raise, avoiding the ruby "clash".
^DOCUMENTATION!

0.1.1
^Took the printing madness from release and put it inside "__DEBUG__", it is useless as we can read the scripts and there will be a better way.
^Reworked headers to clean most stuff.
^Took COPYRIGHT notice from ruby packages, as it is not the case in this repository.
