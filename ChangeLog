0.1.2
^The "archive.*" stuff was replaced by external archive extractor "rgssad.c".
^Stuff inside "openres.*" was almost completely remade.
^The atexit and exit functions call were replaced by common exception raise, avoiding the ruby "clash".
^DOCUMENTATION!

0.1.1
^Took the printing madness from release and put it inside "__DEBUG__", it is useless as we can read the scripts and there will be a better way.
^Reworked headers to clean most stuff.
^Took COPYRIGHT notice from ruby packages, as it is not the case in this repository.
