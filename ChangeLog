0.2.1
^Dirty cleanup for debugging something else...
^The Bitmap type now has their proper Rect, it was allocating like mad without reason. The font one will come later.

0.2.0
^Trashed "renderable" and its crazy function pointer jobs, the system is so much clean now, with jobs only working at "sdl_misc.c" side.
^No more insane reallocations, there is a limit for queues and registration.
^RGSS1 remains broken, the "job system" is still being rewritten.
^Limits raised a bit to meet most modern games, they will be allocated differently in the future.
^Cleaning last "statics" before we move to the masterplan: administering everything trough C!

0.1.5
^No more crazy reallocation for queues, only the registry left because it does not reallocate AT ALL!
^Still reworking the script loading, still clueless about the best way to ruby...
^Transitions problem fixed, due to null pointers being addressed to the engine.

0.1.4
^The executable is correctly taken from the INI file, plus some path and case conversions were made.
^Reduced the loop madness from "main_rb" stuff, still far from target of administering exceptions, one function only, but it is way better than it was, except that the reporting is broken. *FIGHT AGAINST RUBY!*

0.1.3
^Fixed segfault by insane reallocating memory like mad at "Audio.c", fixed cache size now and will only change after implementing hierarchy.
^Daily cleanup and testing at "Bitmap.c" and friends, right or not...
^Conclusion of "exit" stuff, there shouldn't be memory or "exitdoers" trouble anymore.

0.1.2
^The "archive.*" stuff was replaced by external archive extractor "rgssad.c".
^Stuff inside "openres.*" was almost completely remade.
^The atexit and exit functions call were replaced by common exception raise, avoiding the ruby "clash".
^DOCUMENTATION!

0.1.1
^Took the printing madness from release and put it inside "__DEBUG__", it is useless as we can read the scripts and there will be a better way.
^Reworked headers to clean most stuff.
^Took COPYRIGHT notice from ruby packages, as it is not the case in this repository.
